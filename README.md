# COVID-19-Detection
Built a machine learning pipeline which takes in X-ray images of lungs, and classifies them as covid positive or normal. Employed a range of machine learning and deep learning models to accomplish this task and conducted a comprehensive analysis of the results obtained. Additionally, explored the transformation of X-ray images into masked representations and compared the outcomes between masked and unmasked images.
